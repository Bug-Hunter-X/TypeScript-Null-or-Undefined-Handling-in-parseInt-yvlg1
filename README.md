This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript related to null or undefined values when using `parseInt`. The `bug.ts` file shows the initial code with the error, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version. The error arises from the possibility of `parseInt` receiving null or undefined, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution utilizes type guards and optional chaining to gracefully handle these cases, providing more robust error handling and preventing unexpected crashes or incorrect results.
